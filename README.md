# Medical Coding AI Assistant

A comprehensive machine learning project for automated medical coding using Named Entity Recognition (NER) and ICD code recommendation algorithms.

## 🚀 Features

### Clinical NER (Named Entity Recognition)
- Extract medical entities from clinical text
- Support for diseases, symptoms, medications, and anatomy
- Uses pre-trained biomedical NER models (HuggingFace Transformers)
- Fallback pattern matching for common medical terms
- Batch processing and entity categorization

### ICD Code Recommendation System
- **Smart ICD-10 code recommendations** based on diagnosis text
- **Top 5 most probable codes** with confidence scores
- **Multi-algorithm scoring**: TF-IDF similarity, keyword matching, entity matching
- **Medical abbreviation expansion** (HTN→hypertension, DM→diabetes, etc.)
- **Specialty categorization** across medical departments
- **Batch processing** for multiple cases

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/medical_coding.git
   cd medical_coding
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install the package in development mode:**
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Clinical NER Usage

```python
from medical_coding.utils.clinical_ner import ClinicalNER

# Initialize NER model
ner = ClinicalNER()

# Extract medical entities
text = "Patient has diabetes and hypertension with chest pain"
entities = ner.extract_entities(text)

for entity in entities:
    print(f"{entity['text']} - {entity['label']} ({entity['confidence']:.2f})")
```

### ICD Code Recommendations

```python
from medical_coding.utils.icd_recommender import ICDRecommender

# Initialize recommender
recommender = ICDRecommender()

# Get top 5 ICD code recommendations
diagnosis = "Patient presents with acute chest pain and elevated troponin"
recommendations = recommender.recommend_icd_codes(diagnosis, top_k=5)

for i, rec in enumerate(recommendations, 1):
    print(f"{i}. {rec['icd_code']} - {rec['description']}")
    print(f"   Confidence: {rec['confidence_score']:.3f}")
```

## 📖 Examples
